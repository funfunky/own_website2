Abstract
Omnibus assertions whether the Big Five (B5) or HEXACO models are “better” fall short. We
argue it is more important to determine their (boundaries of) usefulness and propose a
nomological network approach (NNA) to systematically compare trait structure models in a
common framework. We illustrate how the NNA can be deployed to address several objections
mentioned by Ashton and Lee’s (2020) target article. Further, we outline how the NNA may
provide conceptual clarity and facilitate the integration of personality dimensions outside the
five-factor space.
Comparing Nomological Networks

In their target article, Ashton and Lee (2020) provide a thoughtful and informative
rebuttal of some of the major objections against the HEXACO model. As they noted, “there
hasn’t been […] any systematic attempt to show that the HEXACO model is actually inaccurate
or that it doesn’t really have any advantages” (p. 2). We believe that personality science would
benefit greatly from a thorough investigation into the conceptual convergences and divergences
between the HEXACO and Big Five (B5) trait structure models as well as their empirical merits
and boundaries. Such an undertaking should not aim to claim as an absolute truth that one model
is “right” and therefore always preferable to the other. Rather, the way forward would be to
integrate the two models (Feher & Vernon, 2020) and compare their usefulness for specific
research purposes or applications.
We believe that a nomological network approach (NNA) can achieve this as it allows for
a systematic and fair comparison of the structure models within a common framework. An initial
step is to explicitly specify detailed nomological networks (NNs) for each HEXACO and each
B5 factor on both the conceptual and empirical level. The conceptual NN constitutes an elaborate
theory of the factor-dimension and consists of (a) the respective focal construct along with its
constituting elements, (b) antecedents that temporally precede and/or cause the factor, (c)
proximal and distal outcomes that are consequences of the factor, and (d) concomitants that co-
occur with the factor. The empirical NN comprises empirically substantiated associations
between measures of NN variables. The correspondence between the empirical NN with its
conceptual NN is relevant to issues of measurement and construct validity (see Cronbach &
Mehl, 1955) as well as theory testing.
After NNs for each HEXACO and each B5 factor have been specified, they can be put in
relation to each other within trait models (e.g., HEXACO Honesty-Humility and HEXACO
Comparing Nomological Networks
2
Agreeableness) and across models (e.g., HEXACO Honesty-Humility and B5 Agreeableness).
Factors can then be compared within the NNA regarding their constituents, the strengths of their
associations with other variables, and the nature of these associations (i.e., correlates can be
antecedents, outcomes, or concomitants). If this is done in a comprehensive manner, it allows for
a fair comparison between the two trait models and a systematic evaluation of the usefulness of
specific factors, for example, in predicting different categories of relevant outcomes.
– Table 1 –
We believe that the NNA helps contextualize many of the concrete objections to the
HEXACO model discussed in the target article. Here, we briefly illustrate some examples.
Additional suggestions are outlined in Table 1. For instance, objections concerning the
placement of Honesty-Humility ( HH ) in the trait hierarchy and the benefits of measuring traits at
the level of six factors (see Objections 2, 3, 4, 7, and 11) can be addressed by considering the
symmetry between HH and its correlates. Broad domain-level traits should outperform narrower
facet- or aspect-level traits in the prediction of similarly broad constructs (see, e.g., Ones &
Viswesvaran, 1996), but should perform less well when predicting narrowly defined criteria such
as specific behaviors (bandwidth-fidelity trade-off; Cronbach, 1960). If, for example, it became
evident that, compared with the B5 factors, HH mostly predicts narrower (proximal) outcomes
such as cheating (Zettler, Thielmann, Hilbig, & Moshagen, 2020) but not (distal) life outcomes
such as job performance (c.f. Johnson, Rowatt, & Petrini, 2011), this would indicate that HH
should be placed on a narrower facet-level.
Moreover, to examine whether the HEXACO model captures important additional
variance beyond the B5, the NNs for all HEXACO and B5 factors can be compared
systematically. If the B5 effectively omitted important variance, this would manifest in less
Comparing Nomological Networks

exhaustive and elaborate NNs compared to the HEXACO NNs (i.e., relevant constituents,
antecedents, outcomes, and concomitants of the HEXACO factors could not be identified within
the B5 NNs). For example, delinquency-related variables might be better predicted by HEXACO
factors and, thus, located within the HEXACO NNs but not in the B5 NNs (due to HH; Ashton &
Lee, 2008). This approach can be taken to address the concern that Honesty-Humility is simply
subsumed by Agreeableness in the B5 model (Objection 1). Specifically, the NNs of HH and
Agreeableness can be compared to assess (a) whether theoretically important correlates of H H
not shared with Agreeableness emerge and (b) whether this holds true when looking at
facets/aspects of Agreeableness (see also the previous paragraph on the placement of HH in the
trait hierarchy). Furthermore, a comparison of the NNs of the B5 and HEXACO models on the
conceptual level (i.e., explicitly specifying theoretically predicted associations between NN
variables) would provide an overview of the comprehensiveness of their theoretical foundation
as well as a useful collection of hypotheses. This allows for further systematic evaluation of their
empirical support, ideally us in g pre-registered studies (see Soto, 2019).
Above and beyond addressing the objections raised by Ashton and Lee, the NNA can
also be used to examine the interplay of factors within trait models. For example, one could
examine how the HEXACO factors differentially and jointly predict relevant outcomes (for a
meta-analytical overview, see Zettler et al., 2020). Further, the NNA can be extended by
zooming into the focal construct and specifying its state manifestations, the processes by which
these manifestations are causally determined, as well as the situational presses that influence
them. This would yield a dynamic and more thorough theory of the construct. However,
processes and presses currently still represent “blind spots” for both the HEXACO and B5 model

since they are rarely covered in empirical research (Baumert et al., 2017). This also implies that
both models have not yet been sufficiently compared in these respects.
To sum up, we believe that a systematic comparison of the B5 and HEXACO model is
called for and that a unifying NNA provides the optimal tool for this. Such an attempt might
allow for an integration of dimensions that lie outside the B5 factor space and, ultimately, shed
some light on the nature of personality structure.

For decades, the Big 5 model of personality has dominated as one of the most popular and widely used models of personality. The current article reviews the development and prevalence of the Big 5 model and explores the position of other personality variables not (or not fully) encompassed by this model, to see what lies ‘beyond the Big 5’. We start by comparing the Big 5 to the alternative six-factor HEXACO model, the Supernumerary Personality Traits, and a psychobiological model of personality. We then discuss the Dark Tetrad traits, self-defeating interpersonal styles, and trait emotional intelligence as examples of narrower personality traits which predict outcomes over and above the Big 5. Comparisons between these different personality models and the extent to which other personality traits can predict different psychological outcomes will be used to address the discussion of whether the Big 5 is a sufficient measure of personality, or whether other personality variables need to be also considered for a more comprehensive model of personality. Areas of consideration for researchers investigating Big 5 personality will also be discussed.

The six‐dimensional HEXACO model of personality structure and its associated inventory have increasingly been used in personality research. But in spite of the evidence supporting this structure and demonstrating its advantages over five‐dimensional models, some researchers continue to use and promote the latter. Although there has been little overt, organized argument against the adoption of the HEXACO model, we do hear sporadic offerings of reasons for retaining the five‐dimensional systems, usually in informal conversations, in manuscript reviews, on social media platforms, and occasionally in published works. In this target article, we list all of the objections to the HEXACO model that we have heard of, and we then explain why each objection fails. © 2020 European Association of Personality Psychology

Based on lexical studies, the HEXACO Model of Personality has been proposed as a model of basic personality structure, summarizing individual differences in six broad trait dimensions. Although research across various fields relies on the HEXACO model increasingly, a comprehensive investigation of the nomological net of the HEXACO dimensions is missing entirely. Thus, it remains unclear whether each HEXACO dimension accounts for individual variation across theoretically relevant outcome criteria. We close this gap by means of a large-scale meta-analytic investigation, testing whether each HEXACO dimension is uniquely linked to one broad and theoretically relevant outcome domain. Results from 426 individual meta-analyses, 436 independent samples, and 3,893 effect size estimates corroborate this unique mapping. Specifically, Honesty-Humility maps onto the outcome domain of Exploitation, Emotionality onto Insecurity, Extraversion onto Sociality, Agreeableness vs. Anger onto Obstruction, Conscientiousness onto Duty, and Openness to Experience onto Exploration. Overall, the current investigation provides a comprehensive empirical test of the (breadth of) content captured by the HEXACO dimensions, allowing for a broad specification of the nomological net of the HEXACO model overall.

The Big Five personality traits have been linked with dozens of life outcomes. However, metascientific research has raised questions about the replicability of behavioral science. The Life Outcomes Of Personality Replication (LOOPR) Project was therefore conducted to estimate the replicability of the personality-outcome literature. Specifically, we conducted preregistered, high-powered (median N = 1,504) replications of 78 previously published trait-outcome associations. Overall, 87% of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction. The replication effects were typically 77% as strong as the corresponding original effects, which represents a significant decline in effect size. The replicability of individual effects was predicted by the effect size and design of the original study, as well as the sample size and statistical power of the replication. These results indicate that the personality-outcome literature provides a reasonably accurate map of trait-outcome associations, but also stands to benefit from efforts to improve replicability.

In this target article, we argue that personality processes, personality structure, and personality development have to be understood and investigated in integrated ways in order to provide comprehensive responses to the key questions of personality psychology. The psychological processes and mechanisms that explain concrete behaviour in concrete situations should provide explanation for patterns of variation across situations and individuals, for development over time as well as for structures observed in intra-individual and inter-individual differences. Personality structures, defined as patterns of covariation in behaviour, including thoughts and feelings, are results of those processes in transaction with situational affordances and regularities. It cannot be presupposed that processes are organized in ways that directly correspond to the observed structure. Rather, it is an empirical question whether shared sets of processes are uniquely involved in shaping correlated behaviours, but not uncorrelated behaviours (what we term ‘correspondence’ throughout this paper), or whether more complex interactions of processes give rise to population-level patterns of covariation (termed ‘emergence’). The paper is organized in three parts, with part I providing the main arguments, part II reviewing some of the past approaches at (partial) integration, and part III outlining conclusions of how future personality psychology should progress towards complete integration. Working definitions for the central terms are provided in the appendix. Copyright © 2017 European Association of Personality Psychology

Honesty–Humility emerges as a sixth dimension of personality beyond traits similar to the Big Five and could be a unique correlate of job performance. In this study, Honesty–Humility’s ability to predict supervisor ratings of employees’ job performance was examined among workers who provide care for challenging clients. Employees completed 240 items from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) measuring Honesty–Humility, Extraversion, Emotionality, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience. Supervisors rated employee performance on 35 job skills. Honesty–Humility correlated positively with supervisor ratings of overall job performance and was a unique predictor of performance ratings over and above the five other main factors in the model (Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience). Honesty–Humility appears to be an important personality trait in predicting job performance in care-giving roles. Implications for selecting and hiring personnel are discussed.

This paper presents a discussion of the bandwidth–fidelity dilemma in personality measurement for personnel selection purposes. Should job applicants be assessed on fine-grained personality variables or on broader personality variables, such as the Big Five dimensions of personality? Most human resources practitioners and researchers appear to assume that more specific and narrow measures of personality traits result in better and more fine-grained understanding of the person, and therefore ought to be preferred over global measures. We review evidence that when the criterion of interest is job performance, broader personality measures may be preferable over narrowly focused ones. It appears that the alleged advantages of narrowly defined traits and narrowly constructed measures are mainly due to erroneous conventional beliefs predicated upon statistical artifacts. In personnel selection research and practice, we advocate the use of broader personality traits for both better prediction and explanation.

We examined two questions involving the relative validity of the HEXACO and Five-Factor Models of personality structure. First, would the HEXACO model outpredict the Five-Factor Model (FFM) with regard to several diverse criteria that are conceptually relevant to the Honesty–Humility dimension of personality? If so, would the addition of a proxy Honesty–Humility scale—as computed from relevant facets of the FFM Agreeableness domain—allow the FFM to achieve predictive validities matching those of the HEXACO model? Results from self- and observer ratings in three samples (each N > 200) indicated that the HEXACO model showed considerable predictive validity advantages over the FFM. When a measure of Honesty–Humility derived from the FFM was added to the original five domains of that model, the predictive validity reached that of the HEXACO model for some criteria, but remained substantially below for others.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in people’s private and public lives that are unprecedented in modern history. However, little is known about the differential psychological consequences of restrictions that have been imposed to fight the pandemic. In a large and diverse German sample (N = 1,320), we examined how individual differences in psychological consequences of the pandemic ... [Show full abstract] (perceived restrictiveness of government-supported measures; global pandemic-related appraisals; subjective well-being) were associated with a broad set of faceted personality traits (Big Five, Honesty-Humility, Dark Triad). Facets of Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Openness were among the strongest and most important predictors of psychological outcomes, even after controlling for basic socio-demographic variables (gender, age). These findings suggest that psychological consequences of the pandemic depend on personality and thus add to the growing literature on the importance of considering individual differences in crisis situations.

The results showed that the five domains of the HEXACO model corresponded to the Five-Factor domains and were relative to the Big Five personality domains as a whole, but the sixth domain, Honesty-Humility, showed weak to moderate correlations with some factors of the NEO-FFI and the IPIP Big Five scales. These results suggest that the Honesty-Humility domain is independent of the five fundamental personality factors and that the HEXACO-PI is a useful and reliable questionnaire for investigating personality structure in cross-cultural and other context.

Objective: People differ in their aspirations to take the managerial position if their target company violates ethical standards. However, it is not clear what influences their decision. In our study, we test the structural hypothesis concerning the relation between particular personality traits and decision-making under ethically relevant situation. In order to explain the inter-individual ... [Show full abstract] differences, we examine the relation between decision for (or against) managerial position under ethically different conditions and the underlying psychological processes as measured by the HEXACO personality inventory. HEXACO model distinguishes 6 personality dimensions: Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience; each dimension is composed of four sub-dimensions (facets). In our study, we take into account four facets of the Honesty-Humility scale, because this scale attempts to measure the ethical dimension of personality. Sample and methods: In our study, 157 undergraduate students of business filled the questionnaire containing HEXACO-60 items and responded further questions dealing with their managerial decisions under ethical constraints. Structural Equation Modelling was used to link the relevant personality traits and decision-making. Results: Four facets of Honesty-Humility Scale are arranged into two latent variables (Relationship towards Material Values and Relationship towards Other People). These latent variables significantly predict managerial decisions both in ethically neutral as well as in ethically problematic situation.

Despite its comprehensiveness, the Big Five model of personality does not adequately assess socially malevolent traits. Its ability to predict certain criteria related to materialism and unethical behavior, for example, may be curtailed. In the present study, several supernumerary traits known to fall outside the Big Five factor space were posited to provide incremental validity in predicting ... [Show full abstract] such criterion outcomes. Using self- and informant-reports, we found that supernumerary traits such as seductiveness, (low) thriftiness, and (low) integrity explained variance in relevant criteria not explained by the Big Five factors. These associations persisted even when the criterion variables were assessed 6 months later. Our data support the call to routinely consider variables beyond the traditional Big Five personality factors in order to optimize the prediction and understanding of human behavior.
