Highlights

•

    Close replications are an important part of cumulative science.
•

    Yet, little agreement exists about what makes a replication convincing.
•

    We develop a Replication Recipe to facilitate close replication attempts.
•

    This includes the faithful recreation of a study with high statistical power.
•

    We discuss evaluating replication results and limitations of replications.

Abstract

Psychological scientists have recently started to reconsider the importance of close replications in building a cumulative knowledge base; however, there is no consensus about what constitutes a convincing close replication study. To facilitate convincing close replication attempts we have developed a Replication Recipe, outlining standard criteria for a convincing close replication. Our Replication Recipe can be used by researchers, teachers, and students to conduct meaningful replication studies and integrate replications into their scholarly habits.
