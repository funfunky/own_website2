Abstract

Recently, similar six-factor solutions have emerged in lexical studies across languages, giving rise to the HEXACO model of personality. As a core extension of its most well-known predecessor, the five-factor model, the HEXACO model distinguishes between two factors predicting complimentary aspects of prosocial behavior or, more specifically, reciprocal altruism: Honesty–Humility (the tendency toward active cooperation, i.e. non-exploitation) and Agreeableness (the tendency toward reactive cooperation, i.e. non-retaliation). However, this dissociation has not yet been tested to its full extent. To this end, we herein present re-analyses of published studies ( N  = 1090), showing that Honesty–Humility, but not Agreeableness, indeed predicts active cooperation. More importantly, in a new experiment ( N  = 410), we found a pattern of two concurrent selective associations, supporting the theoretical distinction between the two factors: Honesty–Humility (but not Agreeableness) predicted active cooperation (non-exploitation in the dictator game), whereas Agreeableness (but not Honesty–Humility) was linked to reactive cooperation (non-retaliation in the ultimatum game).
Highlights

► The HEXACO model distinguishes between Honesty–Humility and Agreeableness. ► These should selectively predict non-exploitation and non-retaliation, respectively. ► So far, only necessary but no sufficient empirical evidence for this distinction is available. ► In re-analyses of five studies ( N  = 1090), we show selective associations with non-exploitation. ► In a new experiment ( N  = 410), we find a full pattern of two selective associations.
