Abstract

How holistically is human creativity defined, investigated, and understood? Until recently, most scientific research on creativity has focused on its positive side. However, creativity might not only be a desirable resource but also be a potential threat. In order to redefine creativity we need to analyze and understand definitions, collocations, and consequences of creativity. In this paper, we reviewed 42 explicit definitions and 120 collocations. The thematic analysis of our data reveals that the vast majority of creativity definitions do not emphasize the positive/negative aspects of the concept. Neither are the negative aspects of creativity emphasized in its numerous collocations. Thus, we propose a comprehensive definition of creativity and a three‐dimensional analytical framework for investigating its consequences, positive and/or negative. Finally, we highlight the need to move to a new era of conscientious creativity , in which all humans are considered able and wise enough to create something ethical and constructive for everyone in society.
