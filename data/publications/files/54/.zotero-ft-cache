Highlights

•

    Replication of the effectiveness of the three REVISE principles (N = 5039).
•

    No support that REminding (ethical priming) reduces dishonesty.
•

    VIsibility (overtly monitoring responses) reduces dishonesty.
•

    SElf-engagement (retyping an honesty statement) reduces dishonesty.
•

    No support for potential interactions between the manipulations.

Abstract

Dishonest behavior poses a crucial threat to individuals and societies at large. To highlight situation factors that potentially reduce the occurrence and/or extent of dishonesty, Ayal, Gino, Barkan, and Ariely (2015) introduced the REVISE framework, consisting of three principles: REminding, VIsibility, and SElf-engagement. The evidence that the three REVISE principles actually reduce dishonesty is not always strong and sometimes even inconsistent, however. We herein thus conceptually replicate three suggested manipulations, each serving as an operationalization of one principle. In a large study with eight conditions and 5,039 participants, we link the REminding, VIsibility, and SElf-engagement manipulations to dishonesty, compare their effectiveness with each other, and test for potential interactions between them. Overall, we find that VIsibilty (in terms of overtly monitoring responses) and SElf-engagement (in terms of retyping an honesty statement) reduce dishonest behavior. We find no support for the effectiveness of REminding (in terms of ethical priming) or for any interaction between the REVISE principles. We also report two preregistered manipulation-check studies and discuss policy implications of our findings.
