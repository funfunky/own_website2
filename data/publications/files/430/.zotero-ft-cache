Highlights

•

    Honesty-Humility (HH) is negatively linked to dishonest behavior.
•

    The HH-dishonesty link is unaffected by the utility of incentives.
•

    This finding replicates for incentive size and different framing of incentives.

Abstract

Previous research consistently showed a negative link between Honesty-Humility (HH) and dishonest behavior. However, most prior research neglected the influence of situational factors and their potential interaction with HH. In two incentivized experiments ( N  = 322, N  = 552), we thus tested whether the (subjective) utility of incentives moderates the HH-dishonesty link. Replicating prior evidence, HH showed a consistent negative link to dishonesty. However, the utility of incentives did not moderate this association, neither when manipulated through incentive size ( BF 01  = 5.7) nor when manipulated through gain versus loss framing ( BF 01  = 20.4). These results demonstrate the robustness of the HH-dishonesty link.
