I am a Postdoc in the Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences at Aarhus University. Prior to that, I finished my PhD at the University of Copenhagen (2017-2020).

Key scientific areas:
- Individual and situational predictors of antisocial behaviors, such as dishonesty,
bribery, and corruption
- Interactions between the prosocial personality trait of Honesty-Humility and
situational factors in predicting antisocial behavior
- Relations between creativity and antisocial behavior
- The role of (un)ethical justifications in motivating prosocial and antisocial behavior
