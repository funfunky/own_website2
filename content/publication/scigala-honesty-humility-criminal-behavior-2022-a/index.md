abstract: Does the basic prosocial trait of Honesty-Humility predict crime? We test
  whether Honesty-Humility (1) differentiates between prisoners and the national population,
  (2) predicts the frequency of criminal behavior (the number of reported crimes),
  and (3) predicts the type of crime leading to imprisonment (violent, non-violent,
  and sexual). We found that prisoners had lower levels of Honesty-Humility than the
  national population, but Honesty-Humility did not predict the number of reported
  crimes and the type of crime leading to imprisonment in this group. Additionally,
  we examined if Honesty-Humility predicts violent (defensive and sadistic aggression)
  and non-violent (cheating) lab antisocial behavior among prisoners. We found that
  Honesty-Humility negatively predicted violent, but it did not significantly relate
  to non-violent antisocial behavior in this group.
