abstract: Corrupted collaboration, that is, gaining personal profits through collaborative
  immoral acts, is a common and destructive phenomenon in societies. Despite the societal
  relevance of corrupted collaboration, the role of one’s own as well as one’s partner’s
  characteristics has hitherto remained unexplained. In the present study, we test
  these roles using the sequential dyadic die-rolling paradigm ( N = 499 across five
  conditions). Our results indicate that interacting with a fully dishonest partner
  leads to higher cheating rates than interacting with a fully honest partner, although
  being paired with a fully honest partner does not eliminate dishonesty completely.
  Furthermore, we found that the basic personality dimension of Honesty–Humility is
  consistently negatively related to collaborative dishonesty irrespective of whether
  participants interact with fully honest or fully dishonest partners. Overall, our
  investigation provides new insights on the role of interaction partner’s characteristics
  in settings allowing for corrupted collaboration.
