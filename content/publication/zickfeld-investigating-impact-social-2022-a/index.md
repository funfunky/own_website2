abstract: Social commitment (i.e., feeling committed to other individuals or groups)
  influences our behavior in various ways. Recent studies suggest that social commitment
  can increase dishonest behavior, while feeling commitment to social norms might
  decrease it. However, recent meta-investigations highlight severe heterogeneity
  of these effects. Additionally, research is scarce about what happens if individuals
  feel committed to individuals and social norms at the same time. The current pre-registered
  project, investigated the influence of social commitment on dishonest behavior by
  sampling 6,026 participants across three countries (the UK, the US, and Mexico)
  and various methodologies. We found no evidence that social commitment to other
  individuals increased dishonesty (OR =1.05 [.95, 1.17]), and preliminary evidence
  suggesting that commitment to social norms might decrease dishonesty (OR =.81 [.73,
  .90]). In addition, commitment to social norms was less effective if participants
  were committed to a partner at the same time (OR =.93 [.83, 1.03]).
