abstract: 'Abstract. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has strongly affected
  individuals and societies worldwide. In this review and meta-analysis, we investigated
  how aversive personality traits – that is, relatively stable antisocial personality
  characteristics – related to how individuals perceived, evaluated, and responded
  to the COVID-19 pandemic. Across 34 studies with overall 26,780 participants, we
  found that people with higher scores in aversive personality traits were less likely
  to perceive guidelines and restrictions to curb the spread of the virus as protective
  ([Formula: see text] = −.11), to engage in health behaviors related to COVID-19
  ([Formula: see text] = −.16), and to engage in non-health-related prosocial behavior
  related to COVID-19 ([Formula: see text] = −.14). We found no consistent relation
  between aversive personality and negative effect regarding the pandemic. The results
  thus indicate the importance of aversive personality traits in understanding individual
  differences with regard to COVID-19.'
