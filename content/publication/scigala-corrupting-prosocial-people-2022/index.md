abstract: Cooperation—although typically connoted with prosocial behaviour—plays a
  crucial role in facilitating bribery. Herein, we ask (i) whether emphasizing the
  cooperative aspect of bribery (i.e., using cooperation framing) increases bribery,
  and (ii) who is most likely to be corrupted by cooperation framing, considering
  people’s personality. We suggest a well-powered study (N = 5,500) testing whether
  cooperation (vs. neutral and bribery, respectively) framing increases bribery engagement
  in a bribery game, and, if so, whether this is the case for cooperative individuals
  in particular—i.e., people with higher levels of the basic trait of Honesty-Humility.
  Supporting this idea, we present a Pilot Study (N = 796) showing that (1) cooperation
  (vs. bribery) framing increased the probability of offering and accepting bribes
  by 119% and 85%, respectively, and that (2) cooperation (vs. bribery) framing increased
  the probability of offering and accepting bribes among participants with higher,
  but not lower, levels of Honesty-Humility.
