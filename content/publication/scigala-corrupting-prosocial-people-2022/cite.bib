 abstract = {Cooperation—although typically connoted with prosocial behaviour—plays a crucial role in facilitating bribery. Herein, we ask (i) whether emphasizing the cooperative aspect of bribery (i.e., using cooperation framing) increases bribery, and (ii) who is most likely to be corrupted by cooperation framing, considering people’s personality. We suggest a well-powered study (N = 5,500) testing whether cooperation (vs. neutral and bribery, respectively) framing increases bribery engagement in a bribery game, and, if so, whether this is the case for cooperative individuals in particular—i.e., people with higher levels of the basic trait of Honesty-Humility. Supporting this idea, we present a Pilot Study (N = 796) showing that (1) cooperation (vs. bribery) framing increased the probability of offering and accepting bribes by 119% and 85%, respectively, and that (2) cooperation (vs. bribery) framing increased the probability of offering and accepting bribes among participants with higher, but not lower, levels of Honesty-Humility.},
