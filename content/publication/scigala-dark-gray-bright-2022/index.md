abstract: The question of whether and, if so, how creativity and unethical behavior
  such as dishonesty are related to each other has been addressed in multiple studies,
  with mixed results overall. The aim of this Registered Report is to shed further
  light on this issue. We first present a meta-analysis on the relation between creativity
  and dishonesty comprising the samples from a pre-registered multi-lab study (on
  a different topic), which indicated no relation between the constructs in question
  ( k = 19, N = 2,154, r p = .02). Next, we examined the relation between creativity
  and dishonesty in a study ( N = 1,152), in which we addressed several limitations
  of previous research. Specifically, we examined relations between comprehensively
  assessed creativity and dishonesty using subjective and objective indicators for
  both constructs. We found mixed results concerning the relation between creativity
  and dishonesty. In the majority of the confirmatory statistical tests, subjective
  creativity was positively related, whereas objective creativity was negatively related
  to dishonesty in the mind game. However, in exploratory analyses, we found that
  neither subjective nor objective creativity was related to dishonesty in the second
  dishonesty measure, the sender–receiver game.
