abstract: Does the basic trait Honesty-Humility predict the type of moral concerns
  people express in language? We explore whether Honesty-Humility relates to the expression
  of five moral concerns in language—namely, care/harm, justice/fairness, loyalty/betrayal,
  authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation—as conceptualized by the Moral Foundations
  Theory. Using Natural Language Processing, we screened 16,497 (un)ethical justifications—i.e.,
  reasons for behaving (un)ethically—for the presence of the five moral concerns (N
  = 901). We found that Honesty-Humility related positively to justice/fairness concerns,
  but it did not relate to care/harm, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and
  sanctity/degradation concerns. Our findings thus suggest that justice/fairness concerns
  might serve as one of the mechanisms relating Honesty-Humility to anti- and prosocial
  behavior.
